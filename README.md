# Sanjeevani - An End-to-End Healthcare Solution

## 🚀 Overview

Sanjeevani is a comprehensive healthcare application designed to **bridge gaps in medical accessibility, prescription adherence, multilingual communication, and counterfeit medicine detection**. By leveraging **AI, NLP, and Blockchain**, Sanjeevani ensures:

- **Timely medication reminders**
- **Conversational AI for diagnosis**
- **Blockchain-backed medicine verification**

## 🔥 The Problem & Our Idea

### Problems We Address:
- **Language Barriers**: Patients struggle to communicate symptoms and understand prescriptions due to multilingual challenges.
- **Prescription Adherence**: Rural patients often forget or misinterpret medicine intake schedules.
- **Counterfeit Medicines**: Lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain leads to fake medicine circulation.
- **Latency in Symptom Analysis**: Existing AI-based diagnosis systems have high latency in voice-to-voice interactions.

### Our Solution:
✅ **Conversational AI for Diagnosis**: A voice-to-voice system for **multilingual symptom analysis**.  
✅ **Prescription Analysis & Reminders**: Converts unstructured doctor prescriptions into structured reminders.  
✅ **Blockchain for Fake Medicine Detection**: Scans medicines across the supply chain to verify authenticity.  
✅ **Menstrual Health & Nutrition Guide**: Personalized diet plans based on **menstrual phase, location, budget, and available resources**.  

## 💡 Challenges We Faced

### Voice-to-Voice Conversational AI
- Handling **latency** issues in real-time voice interactions.
- Developing a **low-latency symptom analysis** system.
- Supporting **multilingual conversations** for better accessibility.

### Prescription Analysis
- Parsing **inconsistent doctor handwriting** and unstructured prescriptions.
- Standardizing **time references** (e.g., 'after lunch' varies across regions).
- Ensuring **accessibility for patients with basic mobile phones**.

### Blockchain for Fake Medicine Detection
- **Tracking medicines** across manufacturer, producer, and distributor levels.
- Developing a **QR-based verification system** for governments and NGOs.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Prescription Reminder System
